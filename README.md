# assistant
Python assistant that can google things and have a simple conversation.

Can be run in the console or with the gui (which needs more work done). Running the gui file and pressing the on button turns the assistant on.
- Assistant greets you differently depending on the time of day, and then starts listening.
- If you say "google", it opens the google main page
- If you say anything after "google" it googles that phrase and opens that page on chrome
- If you don't say anything, it will ask you to repeat your input, wait, and then turn off
- The exe and batch files can run only if the main.py is in the same directory (so they are not completely independent, this is because of the external dependencies).
